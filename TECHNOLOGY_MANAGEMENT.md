# Technology Management System

## Overview
The Technology Management System has been successfully integrated into the ESD & Latchup Guidelines application. This system provides a comprehensive interface for managing technology nodes and their configurations.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Dashboard Integration
- Enhanced dashboard now includes:
  - **Rule Management System** - Manage ESD/Latchup design rules
  - **Template Management** - Design and customize document templates
  - **Technology Management** - Configure technology nodes and parameters
  - **Quick Actions** section with common workflows
  - **Typical Workflows** with 4 pre-defined workflows:
    - New Technology Setup
    - Rule Updates
    - Document Generation
    - Quality Review

### 2. Technology Management Interface
Located at `/technologies/manage`, this interface provides:

#### Views
- **Card View**: Visual grid layout showing technology cards with:
  - Technology name and description
  - Rule statistics (Total, ESD, Latchup rules)
  - Quick action buttons (View Rules, Generate Guidelines)
  - Edit and Delete options on hover
  
- **Table View**: DataTable-powered list with:
  - Sortable columns
  - Search functionality
  - Pagination
  - Quick access to actions

#### Features
- **Create New Technology**: Modal form with fields for:
  - Technology name
  - Description
  - Foundry information
  - Node size
  - Technology features (FinFET, HV Support, RF Support)
  
- **Edit Technology**: Update existing technology information
- **Delete Technology**: Remove technologies (with protection against deleting technologies with associated rules)
- **Statistics**: Real-time display of rule counts per technology

### 3. API Endpoints
New RESTful API endpoints at `/technologies/`:
- `GET /technologies` - List all technologies
- `GET /technologies/stats` - Get technologies with rule statistics
- `POST /technologies` - Create new technology
- `GET /technologies/{id}` - Get specific technology
- `PUT /technologies/{id}` - Update technology
- `DELETE /technologies/{id}` - Delete technology

### 4. Navigation Updates
- Added "Technologies" link to all main navigation bars
- Updated dashboard to properly link to technology management
- Consistent navigation across all management interfaces

## Usage

### Creating a New Technology
1. Navigate to Dashboard or Technology Management
2. Click "New Technology" button
3. Fill in the required information
4. Save the technology

### Managing Technologies
1. Use Card View for visual overview
2. Switch to Table View for detailed list
3. Click on any technology card to edit
4. Use action buttons for quick operations

### Workflow Integration
The technology management integrates seamlessly with existing workflows:
- Create technology → Import PDFs → Validate rules → Generate guidelines
- Technologies are available in rule creation and template management
- Filter rules and templates by technology

## Technical Details

### Files Created/Modified
1. **New Files**:
   - `/app/api/technology_endpoints.py` - API endpoints and routes
   - `/app/templates/technology_management.html` - Management interface

2. **Modified Files**:
   - `/app/main.py` - Added technology router
   - `/app/templates/dashboard.html` - Fixed technology management link
   - `/app/templates/rule_management.html` - Added navigation link
   - `/app/templates/template_management.html` - Added navigation link

### Database Schema
Uses existing Technology model with:
- id, name, description
- Timestamps (created_at, updated_at)
- Relationships with rules and templates

### Security
- Input validation on all forms
- Protection against deleting technologies with associated rules
- Proper error handling and user feedback

## Next Steps
To further enhance the technology management system, consider:
1. Adding bulk import/export functionality
2. Technology comparison features
3. Advanced search and filtering
4. Technology versioning and history tracking
5. Integration with external foundry databases
