# MCP Server Integration Implementation

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server Integration has been implemented to provide AI-enhanced document analysis capabilities for the ESD & Latch-up Guideline Generator application. This integration allows the application to send documents to an MCP server for advanced rule extraction, improving the accuracy and comprehensiveness of extracted guidelines.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. MCP Client
- Created a flexible client for communicating with MCP servers
- Implemented asynchronous communication for better performance
- Added robust error handling and status tracking
- Provided configurable options for AI-assisted analysis

### 2. Configuration Management
- Added MCP server configuration in JSON format
- Implemented environment variable support for secure credential storage
- Created override mechanisms for different environments

### 3. Document Processing Integration
- Integrated MCP analysis into the document processing workflow
- Added background task processing to handle long-running operations
- Implemented confidence scoring for extracted rules

### 4. User Interface
- Created dedicated MCP processing page
- Added MCP server status indicator
- Implemented "Process with AI" option for documents
- Enhanced document list with processing status indicators

## Technical Details

### MCP Client

The client is implemented using `httpx` for asynchronous HTTP requests and includes:
- Server availability checking (`ping`)
- Document analysis capabilities
- Base64 encoding for secure document transmission
- Task polling for asynchronous operations

### Document Processing Workflow

1. User uploads document through standard interface
2. User chooses between standard or AI-assisted processing
3. For AI processing, document is sent to MCP server
4. Server analyzes document and returns structured data
5. Results are filtered by confidence threshold
6. Extracted rules are added to validation queue
7. Document status is updated in database

### Confidence Scoring

Rules extracted by the MCP server include confidence scores:
- High (0.8 - 1.0): Minimal review needed
- Medium (0.5 - 0.79): Should be reviewed
- Low (<0.5): Flagged for careful review or rejection

## Usage Instructions

1. **Configure MCP Server**:
   - Update `config/mcp_config.json` with server URL and API key
   - Alternatively, set environment variables `MCP_SERVER_URL` and `MCP_API_KEY`

2. **Process Documents with AI**:
   - Navigate to the MCP Processing page
   - Select document and click "Process with AI"
   - Monitor processing status on the documents page
   - Review extracted rules in the validation queue (coming soon)

3. **Check MCP Server Status**:
   - The status indicator at the top of the MCP page shows connection status
   - Green indicator means the server is available
   - Red indicator means connection issues

## Testing

To test the MCP integration:

1. Start your local MCP server or configure a remote one
2. Run `python test_mcp_connection.py` to verify connectivity
3. Upload a test document and process it with AI
4. Check the extracted rules in the database

## Next Steps

Future enhancements could include:
- Implementing rule comparison between standard and AI extraction
- Adding visual indicators for confidence scores
- Creating detailed analysis reports for extracted content
- Supporting additional MCP server capabilities as they become available
- Enhancing error handling and retry mechanisms
