- **Variable System**: Use placeholders like `{{technology_name}}` for dynamic content
- **Multiple Types**: 
  - Guideline documents (full design manuals)
  - Individual rule templates
  - Email notifications
  - Summary reports
- **CSS Styling**: Customize appearance with built-in styles
- **Technology-Specific**: Different templates for different process nodes

**Use Case**: Generate standardized design rule documents for each technology

---

### 5. Technology Management
**Purpose**: Organize rules by semiconductor process technology

- **Technology Profiles**: Define process nodes (180nm, 65nm, 28nm, etc.)
- **Process Parameters**: Store HBM/CDM targets, clamp specifications
- **Technology-Specific Rules**: Link rules to applicable technologies
- **Cross-Reference**: Identify rules that apply to multiple nodes

**Use Case**: Manage different rule sets for different technology nodes

---

### 6. Dashboard & Analytics
**Purpose**: Overview of system status and metrics

- **Statistics Overview**: 
  - Total rules count
  - Rules by type (ESD vs Latchup)
  - Technology coverage
  - Validation queue status
- **Quick Actions**: Direct access to common tasks
- **Recent Activity**: Track latest changes and additions

**Use Case**: Monitor system health and identify areas needing attention

---

### 7. MCP Server Integration
**Purpose**: AI-powered document analysis

- **Advanced Extraction**: Use machine learning for complex document parsing
- **Context Understanding**: Identify relationships between rules
- **Continuous Learning**: Improve extraction accuracy over time
- **VS Code Integration**: Direct integration with development environment

**Use Case**: Handle complex technical documents with tables, images, and mixed formats
