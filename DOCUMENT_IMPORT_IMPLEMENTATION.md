# Document Import System Implementation

## Overview

The Document Import System has been implemented to allow users to upload and process various document formats (Excel, PDF, Word) to extract rule information automatically. This system is part of the ESD & Latch-up Guideline Generator application and serves as a data input pipeline for rule extraction.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Document Upload Interface
- Created an intuitive user interface for uploading documents
- Added validation for supported file formats
- Implemented progress tracking for uploads
- Added responsive design for better user experience

### 2. Document Management Interface
- Created a document listing page with filtering options
- Implemented document processing functionality
- Added status tracking for processed documents
- Provided deletion capability for managing documents

### 3. Document Processing System
- Created a base parser class to standardize extraction interfaces
- Implemented specialized parsers for each document type:
  - **Excel Parser**: Extracts rules from structured Excel files
  - **PDF Parser**: Extracts rules using pattern matching from PDF files
  - **Word Parser**: Extracts rules from formatted Word documents
- Added support for extracting metadata and images from documents

### 4. API Endpoints
- Implemented RESTful API endpoints for document operations:
  - Upload document
  - List documents
  - Process document
  - Delete document
  - Get document details

## Technical Details

### Document Parsers

The parsers are designed with a common interface defined in `BaseParser` that requires implementing:
- `extract_rules()`: Extract rule information
- `extract_metadata()`: Extract document metadata
- `extract_images()`: Extract images from documents

Each parser has specialized logic for its respective document format:
- **Excel Parser**: Uses column mapping to identify rule data in tables
- **PDF Parser**: Uses regex pattern matching to identify rule sections
- **Word Parser**: Uses document structure and headings to identify rules

### Database Integration

The system uses SQLAlchemy models to store document information:
- `ImportedDocument`: Stores document metadata and content
- `ValidationQueue`: Tracks validation status of extracted rules

### User Interface

The UI is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing:
- Drag-and-drop file upload
- Progress tracking
- Filtering options for document management
- Status indicators
- Process and delete actions

## Usage Instructions

1. **Upload Documents**:
   - Navigate to the Upload page
   - Drag and drop files or use the file browser
   - Add optional description
   - Submit the upload

2. **Manage Documents**:
   - View all uploaded documents in the list
   - Filter by type or processing status
   - Process unprocessed documents to extract rules
   - Delete unwanted documents

3. **Process Documents**:
   - Click the "Process" button next to an unprocessed document
   - The system will extract rules, metadata, and images
   - View the processing results

## Testing

A test script `test_document_parsing.py` has been provided to demonstrate parser functionality. To use it:

1. Create a "samples" directory in the project root
2. Add sample documents (Excel, PDF, Word) to the directory
3. Run the script using `python test_document_parsing.py`

The script will output extracted rules, metadata, and image information from each document.

## Next Steps

Future enhancements could include:
- Improving parsing accuracy with AI-assisted document understanding
- Implementing MCP server integration for advanced document analysis
- Adding validation workflow for human review of extracted rules
- Enhancing rule categorization and organization
